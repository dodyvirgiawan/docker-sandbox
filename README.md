# Docker Sandbox

This repo contains 2 very basic use cases when creating a docker image:
- `redis-image`: An image that will run a redis-server
- `simple-web`: An express.js web application.

Just to demonstrate my learning on Docker. Look for each folder's readme file on guide on how to create the docker image & how to run them.
